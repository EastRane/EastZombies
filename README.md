# EastZombies

## Description

**EastZombies is a Paper plugin that transforms players who die into zombies with unique mechanics.**

It is designed to create an exciting "Humans vs. Zombies" event on your Minecraft server. The plugin provides two dynamic teams, automatic role switching, skin changes, unique buffs for zombies, and even automatic transitions between voice chat groups.

## Features

- **Transformation into zombies.** Dead players turn into zombies. Their skin changes to a zombie skin, and their nickname is colored dark green.
- **Buffs and debuffs.** On different game days, various enhancements and weaknesses for the zombie team come into effect (zombies burn in sunlight, aggressive mobs don't attack zombies, zombies have their own unique effects, custom zombie compass, and much more, check Wiki).
- **High configurability.** You can disable enhancements, change the day of their activation, set permanent effects for zombies, change the crafting recipe for the compass, and much more.
